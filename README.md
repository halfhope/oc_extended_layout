# OpenCart Extended layout
[![License: GPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL%20V3-green?style=plastic)](LICENSE)

The extension extends the standard layout mechanism, allowing you to show / hide other modules depending on the conditions (filters). It will make the output of modules more flexible, and the content of the site more personalized.

A extension does not hide other modules with CSS, it extends the standard layout mechanism by allowing a particular module to execute or not to execute. The module does not perform unnecessary calculations, does not affect performance.
